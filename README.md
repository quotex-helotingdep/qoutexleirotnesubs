# Volume Oscillator Quotex

## What is the Volume Oscillator?

The Volume Oscillator is a technical indicator that measures the balance
between buying and selling pressure in a market. It is calculated by
subtracting the volume of bearish candles from the volume of bullish
candles over a specified period of time.

The Volume Oscillator can be used to identify potential trend reversals,
overbought and oversold conditions, and divergences between price and
volume.

## How to Use the Volume Oscillator

The Volume Oscillator is typically plotted below the price chart. It
oscillates around a zero line, with positive values indicating that
buying pressure is stronger than selling pressure, and negative values
indicating that selling pressure is stronger than buying pressure.

When the Volume Oscillator crosses above the zero line, it can indicate
that a potential trend reversal is underway. When the Volume Oscillator
crosses below the zero line, it can indicate that a potential trend
reversal is underway.

The Volume Oscillator can also be used to identify overbought and
oversold conditions. When the Volume Oscillator is at or near its highs,
it can indicate that the market is overbought and due for a correction.
When the Volume Oscillator is at or near its lows, it can indicate that
the market is oversold and due for a bounce.

Finally, the Volume Oscillator can be used to identify divergences
between price and volume. When the price is making new highs but the
Volume Oscillator is making new lows, it can indicate that the trend is
weak and may be due for a reversal.
